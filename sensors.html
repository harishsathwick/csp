            <h3>IOT  USED  FOR  THIS  PROBLEM :</h3> <br>
            <p> <pre>Using Underwater Load Cells is indeed a more suitable choice for accurate prawn weight
                 measurement underwater.  Load cells are designed to precisely measure weight and force,
                making them highly reliable for such applications. They can provide accurate readings in
                aquatic environments, where factors like buoyancy and water resistance can affect measurements.
                Load cells are purpose-built for weight measurement and are well-suited for aquaculture applications
                where precision is essential.
               <center>Waterproof Design:</center><br>
                Underwater load cells are specifically engineered to be watertight and resistant to water
                ingress. This ensures that the sensitive components remain protected and functional when submerged.
              <center>High Accuracy:</center><br>
               load cells are known for their high precision and accuracy in weight measurement, even in challenging
                underwater conditions where buoyancy and water pressure can affect measurements.
              <center> Data Output: </center><br>
              Depending on the model, underwater load cells can provide analog or
               digital data output, making them compatible with various data acquisition and monitoring systems, including IoT platforms.</pre></p> <br>
